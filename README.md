## ✨ Features

- 4 dropdown inputs: Topic, Age, Language, Style

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a climate topic, age group, language, and content style
2. App generates a Claude-compatible prompt
3. User copies the prompt to Claude.ai and pastes the AI lesson back into the app
4. The lesson can be copied or reused by students, teachers, or changemakers
